Transcription and Diarization based on OpenAI's [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) 

It augments Whisper's transcription, by adding "speaker tags", so you know who says what. Currently it works for 2 speakers in English, making it ideal for podcasts and interviews.  

**SOTA diarization** on top of Whisper's native features - no other diarization model needed.
