Transcription and Diarization based on [OpenAI's Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)

I trained a classifier on top of Whisper model features, that identifies any two speakers. No third-party package is used for Diarization.
I integrated it with Whisper to get a full Transcription-Diarization software.

Give it a trye!

## ToDo
